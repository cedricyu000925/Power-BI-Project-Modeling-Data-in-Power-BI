# Power-BI-Project-Modeling-Data-in-Power-BI
This is a project where I attempted to clean and transform a dataset using Power BI, implementing appropriate measures and visualize the findings.

# Background
In this project, I assumed the role of an analyst at a company that sells scale model cars. The goal of this project is to model and analyze data from their sales records database using Power BI directly in the browser to extract insights that drive business decision-making. By applying data cleaning, transformation, and modeling techniques, the sales data will be ready to analysis and develop practical skills in working with real-world datasets.

# Steps Implemented For This Project
To successfully obtain the outcomes of this project, I have perform the following tasks:

1. Import the sales data into Power BI

2. Clean and transform the data for analysis

3. Design a basic data model in Power BI

4. Create calculated columns and measures using DAX

5. Build visualizations to extract insights from the data
